# Software Requirements


### Vision

##### We are going to make a dungeon crawler game in which the user controls a character, fights monsters, and saves their 2D world.

##### This project seeks to resolve the tension between character movement and combat to provide a seamless user experience.

##### Our product is an easy, fun, and accessible way for the user to unwind and explore an expanding dungeon space where they, as the hero, fight ever complex monsters.


### Scope (In/Out)

##### •	IN - What will your product do This product will allow a user to play as a character and move within a game world designed as a series of rooms (tiles) where they may fight monsters, including a boss monster.
##### •	Describe the individual features that your product will do. The dungeon crawler has a 4x4 grid map on the web page as well as a rendered character symbol. 
##### •	The user also has an up, down, left, and right arrow they may “click” on to move their character.
##### •	The user also has an attack button they may “click” on to initiate an attack against a monster. 
##### •	Monster fights will be dynamic, with attacks being utilized by the character and monster until one is defeated.

##### •	OUT - What will your product not do. This product will not be larger than current map settings. This product also will have a limit on character classes to no more than 3 (realistically will probably only have one). It will also never become an app and will be tailored for a pc/mac browser page with standard industry keyboard and mouse.


### Minimum Viable Product vs

##### The MVP will be an browser page with the title of the game in the header, a 4x4 tile map with a character starting in the top left tile, an “about” section on the side, and 5 “clickable” buttons on the bottom of the page (4 arrow buttons and an attack button). The character will be able to move to adjacent tiles from user input (but not off the map). The user will either find a blank “room” or one with a monster in it. Upon revealing a monster, combat will be initiated. The user will “click” attack, and the monster will respond, until one is defeated. Once all monsters are defeated, the game is effectively over (a message will appear to signify this). The game is reset upon page refresh.

##### Adding multiple character classes, more types of monsters, increasing the size of the tile map, and adding randomization of where monsters are located within the map.

### Stretch

##### What stretch goals are you going to aim for?


### Functional Requirements

##### List the functionality of your product. This will consist of tasks such as the following:
##### 1.	An admin can create and delete user accounts
##### 2.	A user can update their profile information
##### 3.	A user can search all of the products in the inventory


### Data Flow

##### Describe the flow of data in your application. Write out what happens from the time the user begins using the app to the time the user is done with the app. Think about the “Happy Path” of the application. Describe through visuals and text what requests are made, and what data is processed, in addition to any other details about how the user moves through the site.
